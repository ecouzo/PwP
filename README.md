.ipynb lectures for Painting with Python class
Some later lectures require external python libraries (e.g. PseudoNetCDF).  
I recommend installing the free anaconda python distribution (http://continuum.io/downloads).
Basemap is not installed.  Install it at the command line:

$ conda install Basemap
